# Display currently playing songs

## Problem

Often times the user does not want to do any work but instead just listen to music.
Currently there is no reason to open OOT unless the user wants to sit down and actively search for new music with the graph.
People often discover new music passively by listening to premade playlists and generated recommendations (Discover weekly, continued queues, new releases, etc.)
When a new song is discovered the user might become active and add that song to a playlist or like the song.
This is a very minimal effort approach which is currently not possible with OOT.

## Solution

Follow what the user is currently listening to by adding the song to the graph.
Add the artist, genre and album as well to get more information on the screen.
Display the currently played song along with some extra information on the screen.

The idea is to give an incentive to open OOT despite not wanting to actively do anything.

When the user discovers a song they like, they immediately have information about it on the screen and can act on it if they desire.
E.g. explore the currently played artist or genre more.

These listening sessions can also be saved in form of playlists or graphs to analyze at a later point or to have a good starting point for when the user wants to explore actively again.
