# Playlist generation

## Problem

Currently it is very hard for new users to figure out how the application works,
what it can do and how they should use it to accomplish the goal of finding new music that they are interested in.

## Solution

Streamline some of the functionality to have a more guided experience.

Examples of such streamlined process:

- Put in 5 artists and generate a queue/playlist and show it as graph.
  If logged in to Spotify, offer to create a new playlist or add the result to an existing playlist.
- Choose a playlist and create a new one with songs from the same artists

The idea is to get to a result without much effort.

The sandbox mode that is the current approach can be overwhelming for new users and might lead to frustration.
